# Deep-Learning-0203

Experiments and computer simulations are instrumental in the physical sciences and in engi- neering. Typically, a large number of (simulation) experiments are necessary to gain insight in how a set of parameters affect the experiment’s outcome. For example, a mechanical en- gineer may perform a large amount of computer simulations to study how different materials respond to stress, and a drug developer may perform a large amount of lab experiments be- fore finding a chemical substance that leads to the desired response. The main limitation of such approaches is that experimental capacity is inherently limited, and that accurate simu- lations are often computationally intensive. This opens the possibility for machine learning to accelerate the experimental process.

In assignments 2 and 3, we use deep learning methods to investigate the dynamics of charged particles evolving in a plane over time. In assignment 2, we study the dynamics of particles interacting with each other, aiming to approximate these dynamics with a deep learning approach. In assignment 3, we study the case of a single particle interacting with 3 charges that are present at fixed locations in the plane, aiming to predict these charges from the particle’s path. Additionally, we aim to learn how to simulate a continuation of the particle’s path.
